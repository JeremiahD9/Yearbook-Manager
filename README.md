# Yearbook-Manager
An object-oriented program using JavaSwing with a basic graphical interface designed for my Rutherford Yearbook Advisor, Mrs. Stuart, to efficiently manage yearbook inventory. Features include adding and removing yearbooks, an accumulated profit calculator for tracking sales, and an available profit calculator to estimate potential profits from current inventory.
